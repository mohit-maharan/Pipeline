# 🚀 Azure DevOps Pipeline Testing

This repository is dedicated to validating and experimenting with Azure DevOps Pipelines using YAML-based configurations. It is intended for testing build, release, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and deployment workflows before applying them to production environments.

## 🧪 Purpose

This repo is used for:

* Testing YAML pipeline structures (`stages`, `jobs`, `steps`, `templates`)
* Validating parameterized templates
* Testing conditional logic in pipelines
* Simulating real-world CI/CD workflows
* Integration testing with:

  * Azure CLI
  * Terraform
  * GitHub Actions (optional)
  * PowerShell scripting
  * ARM/Bicep deployments

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following before running any pipeline:

* Azure DevOps account with a project
* Connected Azure subscription
* A self-hosted or Microsoft-hosted agent (Ubuntu/Windows)
* Required service connections:

  * Azure Resource Manager
  * GitHub or other external repos (if needed)

## 🧾 Sample Pipeline (CI/CD)

```yaml
# .azure-pipelines/main.yml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
      - develop

stages:
  - stage: Validate
    jobs:
      - job: TerraformValidate
        steps:
          - checkout: self
          - task: TerraformInstaller@1
            inputs:
              terraformVersion: '1.5.6'
          - script: terraform validate
            workingDirectory: terraform/
            displayName: "Terraform Validate"

  - stage: Deploy
    dependsOn: Validate
    condition: succeeded()
    jobs:
      - job: ApplyTerraform
        steps:
          - checkout: self
          - script: terraform apply -auto-approve
            workingDirectory: terraform/
```

## 🔐 Secrets and Variables

Use Azure Pipeline **Variable Groups** or **Library** to store sensitive values such as:

* Azure Subscription ID
* Service Principal credentials
* Terraform backend access keys
* GitHub tokens

Avoid committing `.tfvars` or `secrets` in the repo. Use a secure pipeline method to load them.

---

## 🧼 Cleanup Tips

If you test Azure infra (Terraform/ARM):

* Destroy resources post-test using:

  ```bash
  terraform destroy
  ```
* Reuse names by deleting old resources from Azure portal if needed.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is an experimental repo. Feel free to fork and experiment, but avoid using in production without a security review.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Remember to monitor the agent log for:

  * Task failures
  * Access permission errors
  * Misconfigured variables
* Logs are your best friend—use them.
* Keep pipelines modular and DRY using templates.
